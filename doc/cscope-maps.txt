						*<C-@>*
<C-@>{Cscope_Search_Types}

     To do the first type of search, hit 'CTRL-spacebar', followed by one of the 
     cscope search types above (s,g,c,t,e,f,i,d).The result of your cscope 
     search will be displayed in the current window.
     You can use CTRL-T to go back to where you were before the search.  

						*<C-@><C-@>*
<C-@><C-@>{Cscope_Search_Types}

     查找出来的结果会在新的窗口显示，这个窗口是按水平分割的。 

     Using 'CTRL-spacebar' *twice* (intepreted as CTRL-@ by vim) then a search type
     makes the vim window split horizontally, with search result displayed in
     the new window.
    
     (Note: earlier versions of vim may not have the :scs command, but it
     can be simulated roughly via:
        nmap <C-@>s <C-W><C-S> :cs find s <C-R>=expand("<cword>")<CR><CR>	

						*<C-\>*
<C-\>{Cscope_Search_Types}

    按一下CTRL-\，再按相应的动作来进行查找，查找出来的结果将会按垂直窗格分割
    
    (Note: you may wish to put a 'set splitright' in your .vimrc
    if you prefer the new window on the right instead of the left
