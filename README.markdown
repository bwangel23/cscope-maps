cscope-maps
==========

##Introduction

The cscope\_map plugin was made by Jason Duell <jduell@alumni.princeton.edu>,it 
is a set of maps for cscope that make searching more convenient. You can get it
from [cscope_mapes](http://cscope.sourceforge.net/cscope_maps.vim). 

And i've changed the <C-@> and <C-@><C-@> key maps. At the sametime, i write a 
vim document cscope\_map.txt in the doc directory

Enjoy the vim and the cscope.
